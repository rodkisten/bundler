# Fábrica Changelog


## Next

- Added template spread props syntax for DOM and component placeholder nodes: `html`<button ...${props}>Save</button>``.
- Added component event prop normalization so `<${Button} @click=${save}>` reaches the component as `props.onClick`.
- Fixed delegated events so root-level delegation no longer double-fires when a direct fallback is also needed for jsdom or isolated userscript worlds.
- Added kitchen-sink tests covering component event props, spread props and stale spread event listener cleanup.
- Added `html.jsx` micro-JSX syntax for registered string component tags: `html.jsx`<Dock />``.
- Added component registry APIs: `registerComponent`, `unregisterComponent`, `resolveComponent`, `listComponents`, and `clearComponents`.
- Added explicit parser-safe component fallback tag support with `<f-component name="Dock">...</f-component>`.
- Added missing-component fallback rendering as `<fabrica-component-error>` instead of silently stringifying or dropping unknown components.
- Added self-closing support for interpolation component tags: `html`<${Button} />``.
- Re-exposed Broto runtime primitives on the public Fabrica API: `signal`, `effect`, `computed`, `memo`, `batch`, `untrack`, `resource`, `configureScheduler`, `flushSync`, and `scheduleTask`.

- Added official component tag composition: `html`<${Button}>Save</${Button}>``.
- Changed `component()` to return lazy component render requests so context is captured at mount time.
- Added component materialization with ownership boundaries, lifecycle cleanup and child propagation.
- Added component placeholder compilation through `<template data-fabrica-component>`.
- Added dynamic child support inside component tags.
- Added Broto owner error propagation and boundary integration for effects, resources and lifecycle callbacks.
- Upgraded Broto resources with reactive source support, cache keys, retries, timeouts and owner error propagation.
- Added owner-scoped child part effects so fine-grained bindings can be disposed by DOM range lifecycle.

- Extracted reactivity ownership into Broto.
- Kept Fábrica focused on HTML, rendering, directives, DOM parts, components and hydration-oriented UI.
- Updated internal imports to consume Broto for renderer bindings and component context ergonomics.
- Removed public signal/effect/computed/batch exports from Fábrica's singleton API.

## 1.1.0

- Added component ownership boundaries powered by Broto.
- Added owned effects, resources, cleanup stack, mount/unmount lifecycle, context and refs.
- Added `boundary()` for render error recovery.
- Added public context helpers: `createContext`, `provide`, `useContext`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added the preferred `jsx.html` micro-JSX namespace for syntax highlighting friendly component templates while preserving `html.jsx` as a compatibility alias.
- Added `component(name, factory)` as a minifier-safe component definition form. The existing `component(factory)` API is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed micro-JSX closing/self-closing component tag regex escaping so compiled bundles keep `\s` matching instead of degrading to literal `s`.
- Fixed dynamic component props in micro-JSX/component placeholders so values like `<TabButton plugin=${item} />` reach the component as the original runtime value instead of stringifying to `[object Object]`.
- Fixed a duplicated local declaration in property binding.
